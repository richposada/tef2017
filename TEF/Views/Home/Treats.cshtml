<h2>Treats and Treasures</h2>
<div id='content_text'>
    <p>
        The EVAN Foundation sponsors the Treats & Treasures Carts Program on the hematology/oncology inpatient units at Children’s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. and at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia on a weekly basis. Every hematology/oncology inpatient room of CNMC is visited by Wendy and Gavin with 2 carts filled with candy and toys. In Philadelphia, two dedicated members of the Child Life Team round the cart each week. Every child and their families pick whatever they want. There are also carts available to patients daily at the hematology/oncology outpatient clinics of Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC and Rockville, MD.

        If you would like to help us stock the carts, please send packages of standard size chocolate/candy, new toys or cash donations designated to the Treats and Treasures cart and we will be happy to share with the kids.
